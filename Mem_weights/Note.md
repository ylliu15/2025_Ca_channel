- Use the SE3-Transformer environment to run the make_fake_ss_adj.py script to generate fake adj and ss files (See the "Conda Install SE3-Transformer" section at https://github.com/RosettaCommons/RFdiffusion/tree/main)
- Weights/checkpoints can be downloaded from:
  `wget http://files.ipd.uw.edu/pub/2025_Liu_Ca_channel/BFF_100.pt`
  There are also `BFF_30.pt`, `BFF_50.pt`, `BFF_70.pt`, and `BFF_80.pt` in this directory. We usually just use `BFF_100.pt`.
